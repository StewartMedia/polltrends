# One Nation remains the top-ranked party by search interest, with an average score of 30.1.

One Nation maintained its position as the leading party in terms of search interest, with an average score of 30.1 and a peak of 40 on February 24th. This is consistent with the significant spikes observed during the period, including a notable spike on February 19th where One Nation's search interest reached 27, which was 5.4 times its average. The party's strong showing can be attributed to ongoing controversy surrounding Pauline Hanson’s comments about Muslims, as evidenced by headlines such as "Pauline Hanson’s Muslim comments have been reported to federal police – but could she face charges?" and "Half of voters ‘seriously considering’ One Nation despite Hanson’s ‘no good Muslims’ comment." These events likely contributed to the party's sustained high search interest.

Labor, in third place with an average score of 7.4, saw a slight decline from its peak on February 24th, where it reached 9. This is reflected in news headlines such as "L-NP Coalition support up marginally in the last week, ALP and One Nation both down slightly," indicating that Labor's support has waned somewhat compared to the previous week. The decline in search interest for Labor could be linked to ongoing political challenges, including criticism from within its ranks regarding environmental policies and agreements with the Greens party.

The overall pattern suggests a stable but competitive environment among the major parties, with One Nation maintaining a strong presence despite some negative publicity. As we move forward, it will be interesting to observe how these dynamics play out in the lead-up to any potential elections.
